## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Kotlin:** A modern programming language that enhances productivity with its expressive syntax, null safety, and seamless interoperability with Java.

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** A design pattern that separates UI logic from business logic, promoting a clean architecture and facilitating easier testing and maintenance.

- **XML:** Used for defining UI layouts in Android applications, providing a clear structure for designing interfaces.

- **Navigation Component:** A library that simplifies navigation in Android apps, providing a consistent way to handle fragment transactions and passing data between screens.

- **Hilt:** A dependency injection library for Android that simplifies the management of dependencies, making it easier to scale applications.

- **Room:** A persistent library for SQLite that abstracts database interactions, providing a robust framework for data storage and retrieval. Room allows for easy integration with Kotlin Coroutines, enabling efficient background operations and data management, while ensuring type safety and compile-time verification of SQL queries.

- **Retrofit:** A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java that simplifies network operations. Retrofit allows developers to define REST API endpoints as interfaces, automatically handling the conversion of JSON responses into Kotlin objects, which streamlines data fetching and parsing processes. It also works seamlessly with RxJava and Coroutines, making asynchronous calls easier to manage.

- **LiveData:** A lifecycle-aware observable data holder that allows UI components to observe changes in data, ensuring updates happen safely.

- **Glide:** A powerful image loading and caching library for Android that efficiently handles image display from various sources, improving app performance.

- **Coroutines:** A feature for asynchronous programming in Kotlin, enabling developers to write non-blocking code for smooth user experiences. Coroutines simplify asynchronous programming, making it easier to manage long-running tasks and improve app responsiveness.


## üõ†Ô∏è Other Features

- **Swipe To Delete:** A gesture-based action that allows users to quickly remove items from a list, enhancing user experience.

- **DiffUtil:** A utility class that efficiently computes differences between two lists, optimizing the performance of RecyclerViews during updates.

- **Splash Screen:** A brief introductory screen that appears while the app is loading, improving user experience and branding.
